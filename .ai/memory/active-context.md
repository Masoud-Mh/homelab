# Active Context

## Current objective
Configure autonomous agent operation for this repository with memory-first workflows. (COMPLETED)

## In-progress focus
- Hook runtime hardening complete: wrapper-based execution avoids dependency on global Python modules.
- Begin roadmap execution using configured custom agents and prompts.

## Next actions
1. Start planning with custom agent `homelab-planner`.
2. Run `/run-frontend-roadmap` (recommended initial scope: `phase=1`).
3. Run `/run-techdebt-batches` (recommended initial scope: `batch=P0`).
4. Run `/sync-memory` after each completed batch.
