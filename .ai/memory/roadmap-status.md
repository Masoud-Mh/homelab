Source: `docs/frontend-react-vite-ts-roadmap.md`

- Phase 1 (Dev Foundation): NOT STARTED

## Batch notes
- Use parity-first migration from static `index.html` into React components.
- Enforce `strict` and `strictNullChecks`.
- Use `VITE_API_BASE_URL` and `useEffect` cleanup for polling.

## Validation baseline
- `npm run build`
- `npm run preview`
